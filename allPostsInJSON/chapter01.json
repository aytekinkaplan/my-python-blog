    "content": "In Python we have lots of built-in functions. Built-in functions are globally available for your use that mean you can make use of the built-in functions without importing or configuring. Some of the most commonly used Python built-in functions are the following: print(), len(), type(), int(), float(), str(), input(), list(), dict(), min(), max(), sum(), sorted(), open(), file(), help(), and dir(). In the following table you will see an exhaustive list of Python built-in functions taken from <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functions.html\">python documentation.</a>"
